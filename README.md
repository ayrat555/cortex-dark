# Cortex Theme

Theme for [my braindump](https://github.com/ayrat555/braindump). Currently largely copied from [jethrokuan/cortex](https://github.com/jethrokuan/cortex) and [bahlo/cortex](https://github.com/bahlo/cortex).

## Icons

The icon and favicon is the
[Brainstorm free icon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/brain_4431852).
I have a license but if you plan to use this repository make sure to either buy
a license or give attribution.
